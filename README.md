# **ParametricExcitation**
Source code of a parametric excitation research developed at `Universidade de São Paulo`.

## Introduction
This is a simple script that allows evaluating the dynamics of a vertical beam under parametric excitation. 
- Assumptions about the model:
  1. Bernoulli-Euler beam formulation;
  2. Linearity (both geometric and physic);
  3. Temporal-spatial separation of the response using three modes;
  4. Galerkin's method with three sinusoidal shape functions.

- Other tools used in the paper:
  1. `Giraffe` (Generic Interface For Finite Element) - a FEM-solver, also developed at `Universidade de São Paulo` by prof. Alfredo Gay Neto and his research group. For more details see <http://sites.poli.usp.br/p/alfredo.gay/>;
  2. A preprocessor tool for `Giraffe`, called `GiraffeMoor` - this code generate complete FEM models of mooring systems for Giraffe.
